# Progress of the project

This is a updated version of the Energy-Efficient project that
drops metrics with RAPL (cuz I can't make the damn thing work)
using, tan tan tan taaaan, DOCKER!

Why docker? Well, **the goal of this project** is to make
it easy for anyone to run the whole benchmark in any computer
given it has docker installed.

## Where Are We?

Project is still in work-in-progress. Actions "run" and "measure"
should already be working; some docker images already compile (see
list below) and it is possible to get some data already.

Even so, a lot is still missing, like, working images for some
languages, updating tests, setting up the tooling that does
the languages performance measuring, etc.

## How Can I Help?

Pick a language of your choice, check if it is working and,
if not, make it work. Also be sure to write compliant, clean,
readable code. Messy merge requests will be refused on the
spot.
